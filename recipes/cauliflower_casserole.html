    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This keto cauliflower recipe is delicious to boot! Cauliflower in a creamy cheese sauce is a perfect keto recipe. Make sure you season well with salt and pepper (nutmeg also tastes great); otherwise, it will taste too bland.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ head cauliflower florets</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil and cook cauliflower until tender but firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain, then arrange cauliflower in a small casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Combine Cheddar cheese, cream, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Cover cauliflower with cheese mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly and golden brown, about 25 minutes.</li>   
    </ol>
